# Advent of JavaScript 2024 - Day 1: Animated Show/Hide Password 🎄🔐

Welcome to **Day 1** of the **Advent of JavaScript**! Today, we'll build an interactive password input field with a fun twist: an animated show/hide feature.

---

## 🚀 Challenge Overview

Create a password input field where clicking on an **eyeball icon** toggles the password visibility.

### Requirements

1. **Level 1:** Toggle the visibility of the password by clicking the eyeball icon.
2. **Level 2:** Animate the background color of the input when toggling the password visibility.
3. **Level 3:** Animate the eyeball opening and closing during the toggle.

---

## 🛠️ Features

- **Password Visibility Toggle:** Click the eyeball to switch between hidden (`••••`) and visible (`password`) states.
- **Input Background Animation:** Smooth color transition when the password visibility changes.
- **Eyeball Animation:** The eyeball smoothly opens and closes, enhancing the user experience.

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the UI components.
- **CSS/Animations**: To animate the background and eyeball.
- **JavaScript/JSX**: For handling the interactivity.

## 🖥️ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
   cd YOUR_REPO
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

## 📚 How It Works

1. **Eyeball Icon:** Toggles the `type` attribute of the input between `password` and `text`.
2. **Input Animation:** Changes background color using CSS transitions.
3. **Eyeball Animation:** Uses CSS or SVG manipulation to simulate an opening/closing eye.

## 🎨 Customization Ideas

- Add different background color transitions.
- Experiment with new animations for the eyeball.
- Improve accessibility by adding ARIA attributes.
