# 🎄 Day 5: Build a Character Counter

## 📖 Description

The goal of today's challenge is to create a **character counter**. This application consists of a `textarea` where users can type text, and a live-updated counter displayed below it, showing the total number of characters entered.

---

## ✨ Features

- A **responsive textarea** where users can input text.
- A **real-time character counter** that updates dynamically as the user types.
- Clean and minimalistic design.

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Users type into the `textarea`.
2. As text is entered or deleted, the character count below the `textarea` updates in real-time.
3. The counter displays the exact number of characters, including spaces and special symbols.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React**: To build the interactive UI.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For managing the logic and dynamic updates.
- **CSS**: For styling the component.

---

## 📋 Usage

1. Type any text in the `textarea`.
2. Watch the live character counter update automatically.
3. Delete or modify the text to see the counter adjust in real-time.
